				About the Legend
			</h1>
			<p>
				
                Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother.
                 Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.
                  Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics there.
                   He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software company Zip2.
                    The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank.
                     X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.  <br><br>
				☛ In 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company. 
                In 2004, he became an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.).
                 He became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar-energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy.
                  In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. 
                  The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces—and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company.
                   In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion.
                    He subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year.
                     In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.<br><br>
				☛ Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and "safe artificial intelligence"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.

                As of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. 
                Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's non-profit Big Green.From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to non-profit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI, which was a non-profit at the time.
                
                In 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.
                He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology.
                
                Vox said "the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.
                The foundation has been criticized for the relatively small amount of wealth donated.In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.
                In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla's shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.
                However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4 billion at the end of 2021. 
                The foundation disbursed $160 million to non-profits that year.
                <br><br>
				☛ Around 75% of Musk's wealth derived from Tesla stock in November 2020,a proportion that fell to about 37% as of December 2022,after selling nearly $40 billion in company shares since late 2021.
                Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed with the board in 2018 to a compensation plan that ties his personal earnings to Tesla's valuation and revenue.
                The deal stipulated that Musk only receives the compensation if Tesla reaches certain market values.
                It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and a company board.
                In the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69 million Tesla shares (about 1% of the company) at below-market prices, which was worth about $800 million.

                Musk paid $455 million in taxes on $1.52 billion of income between 2014 and 2018.[326] According to ProPublica, Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018.
                He claimed his 2021 tax bill was estimated at $12 billion based on his sale of $14 billion worth of Tesla stock.
                
                Musk has repeatedly described himself as "cash poor",and has "professed to have little interest in the material trappings of wealth".
                In May 2020, he pledged to sell almost all physical possessions.Musk has defended his wealth by saying he is accumulating resources for humanity's outward expansion to space.
